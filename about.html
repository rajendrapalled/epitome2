        <h2>EpitomeCircuits Established Since 2011</h2>
        <p> EpitomeCircuits priorly known as <strong style="color:#b20b1e">Kanada Technologies</strong> was founded in
            the year 2011 with the
            aim of
            transforming learning space in engineering education and create a talent pool with an ultimate workforce for
            careers in semiconductor industry.
        </p>

        <p> We offer encyclopedic guidance to the engineering students into the depth and breadth of VLSI technology
            with the most appropriate inter-fusion of theory and practicals with corporate level understanding of the
            semiconductor industry.
        </p>

        <p> We apply faculty expertise towards creating best quality, employable, industry ready semiconductor
            professionals.
        </p>

        <p> We continue to be the best skill development center to enhance the employability of new electronic
            engineering graduates.
        </p>

        <p> We take pride in the core competent group that we have on board. Our mentors with over a decade of
            experience in the semiconductor industry, enable us in creating and fine tuning our training programs in
            sync with frequently changing industry needs. Having worked extensively in cutting edge technology nodes and
            with a passion of contributing to the student community we certainly envisage to make a difference.
        </p>

        <p> Our experts are working in following domains of VLSI design: Circuit Design - Analog, Mixed Signal, Memory
            and Standard Cell Custom Physical Design - Analog, Mixed Signal, High Speed, RF, Memory and Standard Cell
            Digital Design and Verification - ASIC and FPGA
